# 42 libft

This repo contain my libft project that I did at 42 school, if you are currently doing your 42 cursus please know that this repo is not a cheatsheet and copying my work is completly unproductive. If you have difficulties doing an exercise, ask one of your seatmates. Copying someone else work will never help you to improve your skills.

If you finished your libft project and want to know about other possible resolutions of this exercise, maybe you are at the right place.

Project finished with 125%.
